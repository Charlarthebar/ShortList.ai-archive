# ShortList.ai
## A two‑sided job marketplace that always works for you: a platform that collects every job—open or filled—and matches them with people whose skills and aspirations align. 

ShortList.ai is a two-sided job marketplace designed to reduce friction, noise, and inefficiency in modern hiring. Unlike traditional job boards that index only open roles and rely on mass applications, ShortList.ai builds a continually updated view of all jobs—open and filled—and matches them to candidates based on skills, interests, and trajectory rather than keywords alone.

Our core insight is that hiring and job searching are ongoing processes, not one-time transactions. By allowing candidates to follow roles over time and by surfacing qualified passive candidates to employers, ShortList.ai creates higher-quality matches with less wasted effort on both sides.

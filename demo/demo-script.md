# Demo Day Script

## SLIDE 1 — INTRO

Today, hiring is treated as a one-time transaction.  
A job opens, candidates rush to apply, and employers scramble to filter through resumes.

**ShortList.ai** rethinks hiring as a continuous matching process — one where talent pipelines are built *before* roles are even posted.

---

## SLIDE 2 — THE PROBLEM

Hiring is broken on both sides.

**For job seekers:**
- Hundreds of applications lead to low response rates
- Little to no feedback
- No insight into why they weren’t selected  
This results in wasted time and missed opportunities, even at dream companies.

**For employers:**
- Each role can attract 300+ applicants
- Extremely low signal-to-noise ratio
- Repeated sourcing for the same roles
- Qualified candidates are hard to identify quickly

**Everyone loses.**

---

## SLIDE 3 — TODAY’S JOB PLATFORMS ARE DESIGNED WRONG

Traditional platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed are optimized for listing open jobs and maximizing application volume.

This creates an arms race:
- Candidates spam applications
- Employers get buried in noise
- Quality matches get lost

The result is inefficiency, frustration, and missed opportunities on both sides.

## SLIDE 4 — SHORTLIST.AI: A NEW APPROACH

ShortList.ai introduces a fundamentally different model by tracking **both open and filled roles**.

- Candidates can express interest *before* roles open  
- Hiring becomes a **continuous relationship**, not a one-time transaction  
- Matching is **quality-driven**, using living candidate profiles instead of static resumes

## SLIDE 5 — AI-POWERED FEATURES

AI powers the core of the platform.

- **Real-time match scoring** using skill-based algorithms with transparent scoring factors
- **AI screening interviews** that evaluate competencies rather than keywords
- **Smart recommendations**, including:
  - Resume optimization

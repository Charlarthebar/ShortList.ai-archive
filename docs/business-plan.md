# Opportunity Refinement Brief

## Problem Statement

The current job market is inefficient for both job seekers and employers.

Job seekers face an arms race of automated applications, non-transparent filtering, and extremely low response rates. Even qualified candidates often receive no feedback or insight into why they were rejected or how to improve their fit. Employers, meanwhile, are overwhelmed by volume: a majority of applications fail to meet basic qualifications, while strong passive candidates remain undiscovered.

This results in a lot of wasted time, poor matching quality, and low levels of trust on both sides.

## Core Idea/Principle

Hiring and job searching are not one-time events but continuous processes.

Traditional job boards treat hiring as transactional: a role opens, candidates apply, the role closes. In reality, many roles reopen repeatedly, and many candidates are interested in opportunities before they formally exist.

By allowing candidates to follow roles over time and by capturing intent and skill signals continuously, higher-quality matches can be made earlier and with less noise.

## Proposed Solution

ShortList.ai is a two-sided job marketplace that indexes both open and filled roles and matches candidates to jobs based on skills, interests, and trajectory rather than keywords alone.

Candidates can subscribe to specific jobs (even if currently filled) and receive alerts when roles reopen or when their match score improves. Employers can view subscribed candidates and discover qualified passive talent before opening a formal search.

## Initial Target User

- U.S.-based knowledge workers (software, data, product)
- Employers with recurring hiring needs for similar roles

This segment is chosen due to:
- High skill standardization
- Frequent role reopening
- Strong pain from current hiring tools

## Success Criteria (Early)

- Candidates subscribe to filled jobs
- Candidates return to update skills or check match status
- Employers express interest in viewing subscribed candidates

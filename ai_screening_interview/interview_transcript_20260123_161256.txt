[Candidate]: I'm not doing too good, but I'm excited to talk to you in this interview.

[Interviewer]: 

[Candidate]: Not really, but it's okay.

[Interviewer]: That's totally understandable; we can take things at a comfortable pace. Let’s dive in and see how it goes, alright?

[Interviewer]: I'm sorry, it looks like there was a hiccup in capturing your answer. Could you try sharing again about a time when you had to juggle multiple priorities in a fast-paced setting? Unfortunately, there was an issue capturing your response. Could you describe a time when you had to manage multiple priorities in a fast-paced environment?

[Candidate]: During my work yesterday I had a lot of tasks and service tasks to do and I was really overwhelmed but I prioritized them based on level of importance and I worked my way down and was able to deal with all of them eventually and get the most important things done.

[Interviewer]: It sounds like you handled a challenging situation really well by prioritizing effectively. Can you tell me about a time when you had to handle a difficult team dynamic?

[Interviewer]: Tell me about a time when you had to handle a difficult customer inquiry. What was the outcome?

[Candidate]:

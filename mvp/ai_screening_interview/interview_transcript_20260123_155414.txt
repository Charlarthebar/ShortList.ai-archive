[Interviewer]: Hello! I'll be conducting a screening interview for the Sales Support Specialist position. Please provide clear answers with specific examples. Let me prepare the questions.

[Interviewer]: 
I have 8 questions prepared. Let's begin.


[Interviewer]: Question 1 of 8:
Can you describe a time when you had to manage multiple tasks in a high-pressure environment? What strategies did you use to prioritize and stay organized?

[Candidate]: Yeah, so I was in one environment one time and I was very sad, and it was very sad.

[Interviewer]: Follow-up: Can you provide a specific example of a time when you had to handle multiple tasks under pressure and explain how you prioritized and organized them?

[Candidate]: Yeah, it was actually one time I thought that I had a lot of things to do and that I managed them based on priority.

[Interviewer]: Question 2 of 8:
Tell me about a time when you had to handle a difficult client interaction. How did you ensure the client was satisfied?

[Candidate]: I was just clarifying their emotional response and I checked in with them to see if it was working.

[Interviewer]: Follow-up: Can you provide more details about the specific situation and the steps you took to resolve the client's concerns and ensure their satisfaction?

[Candidate]: Uh, yeah, I was talking to my clients and asking them lots of questions to ensure they were content with this customer experience.

[Interviewer]: Question 3 of 8:
Describe your experience with CRM systems. How have you used them in past roles to improve customer management?

[Candidate]: 

[Interviewer]: Follow-up: Could you provide examples of CRM systems you have used in past roles and explain how they helped you improve customer management?

[Candidate]: But, whatever. You wanna, you wanna try if you want, or something? The only thing, uh huh, where, where, where's the sword? Uh, so, this is the file that runs it, and then, it outputs, uh. Do you think that all the files that are involved with it, you can move to a separate, like, uh, like, AI-independent folder? Oh yeah, like a more specific folder? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, I don't know if you can do it where the folders outside Charlie's work, that would be ideal. But, if you can have a folder inside Charlie's work, that would be good. Nice. The only thing I would ask to change is, like, I'm just trying to make the conversation more natural, so, like. You would have, like, maybe, like, 15 seconds of, like, hey, how you doing? Where, instead of, like, questions, you would say, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll ask you a couple questions, like, what's going on? Okay. Yeah, I'll try to. Yeah, I didn't think it would be, like, this quick, but. Yeah, I'll move it out, and then, uh, I'll try to make it more natural. How's everything with yours going? Nice. Okay. Nice. Okay. Yeah, yeah. I think we're making some pretty decent progress. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, for sure.

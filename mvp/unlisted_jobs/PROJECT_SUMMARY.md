## Next Steps (Recommended Priority)

### 🥇 Phase 5-7: Build Inference Models
Use 189k observed jobs to build:
- Salary estimation models
- Headcount distribution models  
- Archetype inference models

**Goal:** Estimate remaining ~40-50% unmatched

### 🥈 Add Blue-Collar Roles (Optional)
Add 10-15 roles: truck driver, cook, factory worker, etc.

**Impact:** +5-10k more PERM jobs

### 🥉 Expand to New Data Sources
State payrolls (NY, CA, TX), federal data, LinkedIn, etc.

**Impact:** 189k → 500k+ jobs

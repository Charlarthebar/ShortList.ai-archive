### Rethinking Hiring as Continuous Matching

*Building talent pipelines before roles are posted*

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

### Hiring is Broken for Everyone

**For Job Seekers:**
- Low response rates despite hundreds of applications
- No visibility into why they weren't selected
- Wasted time on mass applications with no feedback
- Miss opportunities at dream companies

**For Employers:**
- Overwhelmed by application volume (300+ per role)
- Low signal-to-noise ratio
- Repeatedly sourcing for the same recurring roles
- Difficulty finding qualified candidates quickly

---

## Slide 3: The Root Cause

### Today's Job Platforms Are Designed Wrong

Traditional platforms (LinkedIn, Indeed) are optimized for:
- Listing **open** jobs
- Maximizing application **volume**

This creates an arms race where:
- Candidates spam applications
- Employers get buried in noise
- Quality matches get lost

**The result:** Everyone loses.

---

## Slide 4: Our Solution

### ShortList.ai: A New Approach

We track **both open AND filled roles**, enabling:

| Traditional Platforms | ShortList.ai |
|----------------------|--------------|
| Apply when job is posted | Subscribe before job opens |
| One-time transaction | Continuous relationship |
| Volume-driven matching | Quality-driven matching |
| Static resumes | Living candidate profiles |

**Key insight:** Great hires often come from candidates who were "almost right" for previous roles.

---

## Slide 5: How It Works - Candidates

### For Job Seekers

1. **Create a Living Profile**
   - Skills, experience, and preferences that evolve over time
   - Upload resume for automatic parsing
   - Set your search status (active, open, exploring)

2. **Subscribe to Roles You Want**
   - Follow specific positions—even if they're filled
   - Get notified when roles reopen
   - See your match score for every opportunity

3. **Join the Shortlist**
   - Express interest with a 3-step application
   - Stand out before roles are even posted
   - Skip the noise when the role opens

---

## Slide 6: How It Works - Employers

### For Hiring Teams

1. **Build Talent Pipelines**
   - See who's interested before you post
   - Access candidates who subscribed to similar roles
   - Discover passive candidates early

2. **Two-Step Smart Screening**
   - **Must-Have Gate:** Auto-filter on work authorization, experience, skills
   - **AI Ranking:** Score candidates 0-100 with strengths & concerns

3. **Ranked Shortlist Inbox**
   - Review pre-qualified candidates
   - Set your quality threshold
   - Invite top matches to apply

## Slide 8: The Continuous Matching Difference

### Why "Filled" Roles Matter

```
Traditional Flow:
Role Opens → Mass Applications → Hire → Role Closed → [Restart from zero]

ShortList Flow:
Role Opens → Shortlist Ready → Fast Hire → Role "Filled" → Subscribers Stay → Role Reopens → Instant Pipeline
```

**Benefits:**
- Candidates build relationships with target companies
- Employers maintain warm pipelines
- Better matches happen faster
- Data improves over time
